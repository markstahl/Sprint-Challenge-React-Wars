1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React is a Javascript library that creates user interfaces through the use of manipulating data to the virtual DOM. React solves the problem of having a super convuluted webpage by making it a single page application with seemless data transfer and no refresh updates.

1. What does it mean to think in react?

Thinking in React means to plan out your app's future by means of components and data flow. Although this usually changes with the building of your app, it's good to create a model and to go from there. It also helps stop you from repeating unnecessary code.

1. Describe state.

State is data that is created within a component and used there. The data can be changed and stored to the state to be used later.

1. Describe props.

Props, or properties, is immutable data that is passed around to be used between components. Props can only be used in child components.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side effects are either intended or not. Some examples for side effects are changing the DOM and fetching data from an API using the useEffect hook with axios.
